## 🌐 1. Getting Started

**Visit the App:**
Go to the official Starknet Indemnify website.

**Create or Log In to Your Account:**
- You'll need to sign up with your basic information (name, email, etc.)
- Alternatively you can sign up/login via Google OAuth
- If you already have an account, just log in
- One of the login methods is nonce-based login; where you login by signing one time nonce to you wallet address.

**Connect Your Wallet:**
- Click "Connect Wallet" at the top of the dashboard
- Choose your Starknet wallet (like Argent X or Braavos)
- Approve the connection — this lets the app link your wallet for secure transactions

> 💡 Your wallet acts like your digital ID on the blockchain — it's how you pay, receive, and confirm actions.

## 📄 2. Viewing Your Dashboard

Once connected, you'll see your **Payment Dashboard**. It has four main sections (or tabs):

- **Premium Payments** – pay for approved insurance proposals
- **Claim Settlements** – view your approved insurance claim payouts
- **Buy Tokens** – purchase the native token, STINDEM
- **Sell Tokens** – sell or recover your STINDEM tokens

You can switch between these tabs anytime.

## 💰 3. Paying Your Premium

To activate your insurance policy:

1. Go to the **"Premium Payments"** tab
2. From the dropdown list, select an approved proposal (these are insurance requests that have been accepted)
3. Click **"Pay Premium"**
4. Confirm the transaction in your wallet

**The system will:**
- Process your payment on-chain (on Starknet)
- Record the transaction automatically off-chain (in your account history)
- Show you a success message once payment is complete

✅ You'll know your payment worked if you see *"Premium payment successful on-chain!"*

## 🧾 4. Viewing Your Claim Settlements

If you've filed a claim and it's been approved:

1. Open the **"Claim Settlements"** tab
2. You'll see a list of your claims and settlement amounts

**Each entry shows:**
- Claim ID
- Approved settlement amount
- Status (e.g., "Successful")

This page helps you keep track of what's been paid to you.

## 🪙 5. Buying Tokens

You can buy STINDEM tokens, which represent your stake or credits in the system.

1. Go to the **"Buy Tokens"** tab
2. Enter the number of tokens you want to buy
3. Click **"Buy Tokens"**
4. Confirm the transaction in your wallet

**After a few moments, your purchase will be recorded both:**
- **On-chain**: meaning it's verified by the blockchain
- **Off-chain**: meaning it's stored in your user dashboard for easy tracking

> 💡 You'll get a message confirming how many tokens you purchased.

## 💸 6. Selling Tokens (Recovery)

You can also sell or recover some of your tokens back to the market.

1. Open the **"Sell Tokens"** tab
2. Enter the number of tokens you want to sell
3. Click **"Sell Tokens"**
4. Approve the transaction in your wallet

Once done, you'll see a message confirming your tokens were successfully sold.

> 💡 This feature allows you to recover funds or adjust your balance at any time.

## 🧍‍♂️ 7. Staying Connected
